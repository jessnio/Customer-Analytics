# Digital Music Platform

This goal of this project is to implement social and customer analytics into the use of digital music platform. In this use case, High Note company is trying to increase their revenue by converting the non-adopters (customers with free subscription) into adopters (customers with premium subscription). The exploratory data analysis is done to determine factors that contribute towards the subscription to premium services (i.e. customer demographics, peer influence, user engagement). A PSM (Propensity Score Matching) test and logistic regression analysis are also conducted to identify if having subscriber friends will affect the likelihood of becoming an adopter. 

As a result, it is indicated that customers with gender 'male', having a lot of 'subscriber friends' and coming from 'country' outside US, UK, or Germany, will tend to become adopters.
